## Task 1 : Find a reduced cellular model displaying sub-linear responses and supra-linear responses (by varying NMDA-to-AMPA ratio)

## Setting qNMDA to 0 simulates sublinear integration (PV), while integration of NMDA leads to supralinear integration, simulation with single compartment model at default parameters

## Two compartment model for PV+ and SSt+ non-linearity, default parameters to simulate similar responses as compared to single compartment model

## Analysis of non-linearity: Quantificataion of non-linearity in deviation % from expected depolarization. Modulation of parameters in single and two compartment model to reach physiological membrane potential range of non-linear integration(-70 to -55 mV).
